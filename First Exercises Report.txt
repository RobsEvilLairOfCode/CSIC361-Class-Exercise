If we compare the two thread run vs the single thread run, we can see that as the amount of items
in the array increase, it gets closer and closer to the time of the single thread program. It will likely surpass it's time
if we were to multiply the amount of items on the list by another ten. The ten thread program lags behind significantly, likely due to all the overhead,
however it is imporant to note that the time it takes to complete the summation with the ten thread program varies wildly compared to the single and double
thread programs. It is also important to note that as I increase the thread count, the accuracy of the summation decreases. I have no idea why this happenes, and I
have throughly checked my code for a apparent cause, but I have yet to find one.
